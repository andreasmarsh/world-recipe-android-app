Directions:

4.  Leave to cool, cover, and chill for at least 2 hours.
5.  Mix the sriracha sauce with the mayonnaise and set aside.
6.  Slice the baguette lengthways.
7.  Scoop out the inner soft bread so youâ€™re left with a shell about 2cm thick.

9.  Thinly slice the chilled beef, then add a layer to the bottom of the baguette.
10. Top with the carrot, pepper, cucumbers, herbs, and the red onion. It will be very full, so press the top on and wrap very tightly with clingfilm.

13. Stir until the sugar is dissolved then taste, add more fish sauce or lime if you like.
