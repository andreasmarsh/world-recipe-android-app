Sata Andagi


Servings: 50

Ingredients:

oil, for frying
6 cups all purpose flour
3 cups sugar
2 tablespoons baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
6 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
¼ cup orange
1 pinch of orange zest


Directions:

1. Fill a deep pot or skillet with enough oil to come 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
3. Stir in the eggs, milk, and orange juice. Mix until a thick batter forms.
4. Add the orange zest and mix to incorporate.
5. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop ping pong ball-size dough balls into the hot oil.
6. Fry for about 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown. The doughnuts should float to the surface when they are done.
7. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
8. Serve hot.
9. Enjoy!
