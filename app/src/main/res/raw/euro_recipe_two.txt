Patatas Bravas


Serves: 4
Time: 40 min

Ingredients:

POTATO BASE -
4 medium potatoes
Olive oil for frying, about 1-2 cups
Salt

BRAVAS SAUCE -
1/3 cup of olive oil
1/2 Tbsp. of pimentón picante hot smoked paprika
1 1/2 Tbsp. of pimentón dulce sweet smoked paprika
1 – 2 Tbsp. of flour
1 cup of chicken broth or vegetable broth, for a vegetarian version
Salt to taste


Instructions:

BRAVAS SAUCE -
1.  Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
2.  Add the pimentón dulce and pimentón picante and stir until combined.
3.  Add 1 tablespoon of flour and stir until combined. Keep stirring for about a minute, to toast the flour slightly.
4.  Over a medium-low heat, add the broth very gradually, stirring constantly. (This is similar to how you'd make a cream sauce. The flour will absorb the liquid and leave you with a delicious sauce.)
5.  The sauce should start to thicken as you incorporate the broth; add more flour only if necessary to achieve the right consistency (it should be velvety and smooth, but not so thick that it holds its shape alone).
6.  Reduce to low heat and simmer for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7.  Season with salt to taste.

POTATO BASE -
1.  Peel the potatoes, rinse thoroughly, and dry with a paper towel.
2.  Cut the potatoes into bite-size chunks.
3.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
4.  Add the potatoes and adjust the heat to the lowest setting, allowing them to pre-cook for a few minutes.
5.  Remove the potatoes and let them cool in the fridge for a few more minutes.
6.  Turn the heat up to high and add the potatoes back into the pan.
7.  Fry until crispy and golden.
8.  Transfer the potatoes to a plate lined with paper towels to cool, and sprinkle with salt to taste.
9.  To serve, drizzle the bravas sauce over the potatoes.
10. Enjoy!
