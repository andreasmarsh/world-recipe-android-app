Many great Street Foods can be found all across Asia. My app will give your recipes for Bao Buns with Pork Belly (Gua Bao), Rainbow Stuffed Banh-Mi, and Sata Andagi.

Gua bao, also known as pork belly buns, ambiguously, bao, or erroneously as the bao bun is a type of lotus leaf bun from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, with similar variants found elsewhere with sizeable Fuzhou communities. It is also a popular street food in Taiwan.

Originating on the streets of Saigon, the Banh Mi sandwich is a French-Vietnamese hybrid consisting of an airy baguette, sour pickled daikon and carrot, crisp cilantro, spicy chilis, and a cool sliver of cucumber surrounding any number of protein options, from sweet minced pork to fatty pate to sardines.

Sata Andagi are sweet deep fried buns of dough similar to doughnuts (or the Portuguese malasada, or the Dutch oliebollen), native to Southern China then spread to the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa.
