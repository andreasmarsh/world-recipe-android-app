Many great Street Foods can be found all across Europe. My app will give your recipes for Currywursts, Patatas Bravas, and Stroopwafels.

Currywursts were created in postwar Berlin in 1949. They originated as a "poor man's steak", cobbled together using sausages, canned tomatoes, and curry powder. Today Currywursts can be found everywhere along german city streets, being the most popular street food in Berlin.

Patatas bravas are one of Spain’s most popular tapas. They’re the go-to choice for an appetizer or a snack to share along with a round of cañas. The reason is simple: there’s no greater crowdpleaser than a plate of deep-fried potatoes topped with a delicious sauce, especially when alcohol is involved.

A stroopwafel (literally "syrup waffle") is a wafer cookie made from two thin layers of baked dough joined by a caramel filling. First made in the Dutch city of Gouda, stroopwafels are popular throughout the Netherlands and the former Dutch Empire and are well-known Dutch dishes.
